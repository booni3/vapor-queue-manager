# Vapor Queue Manager

This is only a proof of concept at this stage. 

Vapor allows incredible scale, but in terms of a queue system that is not always what we want. In most cases,
other parts of the system (RDS) will not be able to handle everything that is thrown at it.

Added to this, vapor currently does not have any fine grain control over the queue system. Some issues faced:

- There is no job/queue priority. We throw 1000 jobs into the queue with a concurrency of 10 but then our 1001th job will have to wait, even if it is the most critical.
- Jobs cannot be processed in order, unless we setup new environments and/or FIFO queues. This adds a lot of complication and does not place nice with other packages using the queue.
- SQS has some strict limits, such as 15 minutes for delayed dispatching.

This solution fixes these issues and while it may not be best practice, it seems to work with some good scale. I have tested it
processing a few hundred thousand jobs in under and hour. Only one process deals with the database queue so deadlocks should not be possible.

What it allows:

- Multiple queues. These can be either real SQS queues as defined in vapor.yml, the default lambda queue or virtual queues.
- Each queue can be limited by throttle (time) or funnel (concurrency). Note: currently throttle requires redis installed. Funnel uses the standard cache driver.

How it works:

- The SqsQueue class has been overwritten. Now when you dispatch a job it will go into our jobs table. This acts as the buffer between your system and SQS.
- A command (job:push) runs every minute in a while-loop, and picks up eligible jobs from the table to dispatch to SQS. The job is immediately deleted from the table.
- As a job finises or fails the throttle/funnel parameters are updated.
- All throttle/funnel values are stored in cache

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require booni3/vapor-queue-manager
```

After installation, you need to switch out the implementation of the SqsQueue class
in your main composer file. Yes this is hacky, but it is a proof of concept at this stage only.

Adding the `Illuminate` namespace and excluding the original from the classmap will ensure that our
SqsQueue class is used whenever it is instantiated throughout the framework.

```json
"autoload": {
    "exclude-from-classmap": [
        "vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Queue/SqsQueue.php"
    ],
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "app/",
        "Illuminate\\": "vendor/booni3/vapor-queue-manager/src/Illuminate"
    }
}
```

## Usage

- Install the package
- Publish the config and migration
- Run the migration
- Add queues to your config file

In your configuration file, ensure to set the default queue up to match your SQS main queue for
the vapor environment. This is usually "your-app-name-environment"

In the limits section, you can set up both time based throttles and funnel based throttles. 

The funnel implementation uses your standard cache driver (Redis/Dynamo).

For now, we are using redis for the `Redis::throttle` implementation. If you do not have redis installed 
then you can disable this by leaving the allow/every keys as null blank.

```php
return [
    'enabled' => 'true',

    'default_queue' => 'vapor-app-staging',

    'limits' => [
        'vapor-app-staging' => ['allow' => 1, 'every' => 60, 'funnel' => 1],
        'virtual-queue-1' => ['allow' => 5, 'every' => 60, 'funnel' => 5],
        'virtual-queue-2' => ['allow' => null, 'every' => null, 'funnel' => 5],
    ]
];
```
